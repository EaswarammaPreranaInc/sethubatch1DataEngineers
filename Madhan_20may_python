#1.Write  a  program  to  copy  contents  of  a  file  to  a  different  file

1) 1st    file   ---------->    str   object     -------->   2nd   file
                        read()                                write()

2) What  is  the  mode  in  which  is  1st  file  opened ?  --->  'r'  mode
    What  is  the  mode  in  which  is  2nd  file  opened ?  --->  'w'   mode

3) What  action  to  be  made  when  1st  file  does  not  exist ?  --->  Print  a  message

4) What  action  to  be  made  when  2nd  file  does  not  exist ?  --->  Copy  1st  file  to  2nd  file

5) What  action  to  be  made  when  both  the  files  are  existing ? --->
								Copy  file  when  user  input  is  yes  and  print  a  message  when  user  input  is  no

6) Hint:  Use  isfile()  function  to  verify  file  is  existing  or  not
