class c1:
    x = 10
    def _init_(self):
        self.y = 20

a = c1()
b = c1()
a.x += 1
b.y += 1

print(a.x)
print(a.y)
print(b.x)
print(b.y)
print(c1.x)
print(a._dict_)
print(b._dict_)
print(c1._dict_)
```

---

### Issues:
1. **`_init_` is wrong** → should be `__init__` (double underscores):
   ```python
   def __init__(self):
   ```

   Since your constructor is not properly named, it **doesn't run**, so `self.y` is never created.

2. **`b.y += 1` will raise an `AttributeError`**, because `b` does not have `y`.

3. **Typo in attribute name**: `_dict_` → should be `__dict__`

---

### Let's fix and explain it step-by-step:

#### Corrected Version:
```python
class c1:
    x = 10
    def __init__(self):
        self.y = 20

a = c1()
b = c1()
a.x += 1   # a.x becomes 11 (but this creates a new instance variable 'x' for 'a')
b.y += 1   # b.y becomes 21

print(a.x)          # 11 (instance-level x)
print(a.y)          # 20
print(b.x)          # 10 (class-level x)
print(b.y)          # 21
print(c1.x)         # 10 (class-level x)
print(a.__dict__)   # {'y': 20, 'x': 11}
print(b.__dict__)   # {'y': 21}
print(c1.__dict__)  # {'__module__': '__main__', 'x': 10, '__init__': <function ...>, ...}
```

---

### Output:
```
11
20
10
21
10
{'y': 20, 'x': 11}
{'y': 21}
{'__module__': '__main__', 'x': 10, '__init__': <function c1.__init__ at 0x...>, ...}
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class c1:
    x = 10                # Class variable 'x' is initialized to 10

    def m1(self):
        self.x = 20       # This creates an instance variable 'x' for the object (self)

a = c1()                  # Create an instance of class c1
a.m1()                    # Call method m1(), which assigns self.x = 20

print(c1.x)               # Access class variable x
print(a.x)                # Access instance variable x (created inside m1)
```

---

### What happens here?

- `c1.x = 10`: A **class variable** `x` is defined.
- When you do `a = c1()`, no instance variable `x` exists yet — only the class variable.
- Calling `a.m1()` runs the method, and sets `self.x = 20`, which creates a **new instance variable `x`** for object `a`.
- Now, `a` has its **own `x`** (which is 20), **separate** from the class-level `x`.

---

### Output:

```python
10      # c1.x → class variable remains unchanged
20      # a.x → instance variable created in m1()
```

---

### Final Notes:

- If a variable is **not found** in the instance, Python will **look it up in the class**.
- But if an **instance variable exists**, it **overrides** the class variable for that object.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class c1:
    @staticmethod
    def m1(self):
        print(self)
# End of the class

c1.m1(25)
a = c1()
a.m1(35)
```

---

###  Concept: What is `@staticmethod`?

- A `@staticmethod` **does not take `self` or `cls` automatically**.
- You can still name the argument `self`, but it’s just a **regular parameter**.
- It behaves like a **normal function** that's part of the class namespace.

---

###  What happens in this code?

1. `c1.m1(25)`:
   - Calls the static method `m1` and passes `25` as the argument.
   - The parameter `self` is just a name here — it gets the value `25`.
   - Output: `25`

2. `a = c1()`:
   - Creates an instance `a` of class `c1`.

3. `a.m1(35)`:
   - Calls the static method `m1` using the instance `a`.
   - It still passes `35` to the parameter `self`.

---

### ✅ Output:
```
25
35
```

---

### 🔧 Final Tip:

Even though the parameter is called `self`, it’s **not** the instance — it's just a name. You could rename it to anything, like:

```python
@staticmethod
def m1(value):
    print(value)
```

Same output!

Let me know if you want to explore when to use static methods vs class methods.
class c1:
    x = 10
    def _init_(self):        # ❌ Typo: should be __init__
        self.y = 20

    @classmethod
    def m1(cls):
        cls.x = 30           # ✅ class variable x is changed
        cls.y = 40           # ✅ class variable y is created

# End of class
a = c1()
b = c1()
c1.m1()                     # class method is called

print(a.x)                  # 🔍 1
print(a.y)                  # 🔍 2 — ❌ Will raise error!
print(b.x)                  # 🔍 3
print(b.y)                  # 🔍 4 — ❌ Will raise error!
print(c1.x, c1.y)           # 🔍 5
print(cls.x, cls.y)         # ❌ Invalid — 'cls' not defined here
print(self.x, self.y)       # ❌ Invalid — 'self' not defined here
```

---

###  Major Issues in Your Code:
1. `def _init_` ➜ Should be `def __init__`. Your constructor **never runs**, so `self.y` is **never created**.
2. `cls` and `self` are **only valid inside methods**. You can't use them at global scope. So these lines will crash:
   - `print(cls.x, cls.y)`
   - `print(self.x, self.y)`
3. `a.y` and `b.y` do not exist, because constructor didn’t run (due to `_init_` typo).

### ✅ Corrected Version:
```python
class c1:
    x = 10
    def __init__(self):
        self.y = 20

    @classmethod
    def m1(cls):
        cls.x = 30           # updates class variable x
        cls.y = 40           # creates class variable y

# End of class
a = c1()
b = c1()
c1.m1()

print(a.x)                  # instance doesn't have x, so it checks class → 30
print(a.y)                  # instance variable y → 20
print(b.x)                  # same → 30
print(b.y)                  # same → 20
print(c1.x, c1.y)           # class variables → 30 40
```

---

### ✅ Output:
```
30
20
30
20
30 40
```

---

### ❌ The following lines will crash:
```python
print(cls.x, cls.y)     # NameError
print(self.x, self.y)   # NameError
```

They must be **inside a method** that takes `cls` or `self` as a parameter.

---

### Final Tip 💡:
- ✅ `self` → instance methods
- ✅ `cls` → class methods
- ❌ don't use them **outside** the class/method!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class c1:
    @staticmethod
    def m1(self):
        print(self)
# End of the class

c1.m1(25)
a = c1()
a.m1(35)
```

---

### Concept: What is `@staticmethod`?

- A `@staticmethod` **does not take `self` or `cls` automatically**.
- You can still name the argument `self`, but it’s just a **regular parameter**.
- It behaves like a **normal function** that's part of the class namespace.

---

###  What happens in this code?

1. `c1.m1(25)`:
   - Calls the static method `m1` and passes `25` as the argument.
   - The parameter `self` is just a name here — it gets the value `25`.
   - Output: `25`

2. `a = c1()`:
   - Creates an instance `a` of class `c1`.

3. `a.m1(35)`:
   - Calls the static method `m1` using the instance `a`.
   - It still passes `35` to the parameter `self`.

---

### ✅ Output:
```
25
35
```

---

### Final Tip:

Even though the parameter is called `self`, it’s **not** the instance — it's just a name. You could rename it to anything, like:

@staticmethod
def m1(value):
    print(value)
```

Same output!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alright Sowmya! Let's go through this code **with detailed comments** and explain what works, what breaks, and why.

---

### 🔍 Your Code:
```python
class c1:
    def m1(self):
        print(self)

# End of the class

c1.m1(25)
a = c1()
a.m1()
a.m1(35)
```

---

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

#### 1. `def m1(self):`
- This is an **instance method**.
- It expects **one argument** — the instance itself, usually passed automatically as `self`.

---

###  Line-by-Line Execution:

#### ✅ `c1.m1(25)`
- You're calling the method using the **class name**, and manually passing `25` as the `self`.
- So `self = 25`, and it prints `25`.
- **Output:** `25`

#### ✅ `a = c1()`
- Creates an instance `a` of class `c1`.

#### ✅ `a.m1()`
- Instance method is called on `a`.
- `self` is automatically passed as the object `a`.
- So `print(self)` prints something like `<__main__.c1 object at 0x...>`
- **Output:** memory address of `a`

#### ❌ `a.m1(35)`
- You're calling the instance method with **an extra argument**.
- Python automatically passes `self` (i.e., `a`), so `35` becomes a **second argument**, but `m1()` only expects one.
- **This raises a `TypeError`:**
  ```
  TypeError: m1() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
  ```

---

### ✅ OUTPUT (before error):
```
25
<__main__.c1 object at 0x...>
```

### ❌ Then it crashes:
```
TypeError: m1() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

---

### ✔ Summary:

| Line                  | What it does                          | Output / Error             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `c1.m1(25)`           | Calls method with 25 as `self`         | `25`                       |
| `a = c1()`            | Creates instance `a`                   | -                          |
| `a.m1()`              | Calls method, `self = a`               | `<__main__.c1 object at...>` |
| `a.m1(35)`            | ❌ Extra argument → TypeError          | `TypeError`                |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great question again, Sowmya! You're combining `@staticmethod` and instance methods with **the same name** — this is a perfect example of **method overriding within a class**.

Let’s break it down with **comments and final output** step by step.

---

###  Your Code:
```python
class c1:
    @staticmethod
    def m1(self):
        print('static method')
        print(self)

    def m1(self):
        print('instance method')
        print(self)
# End of the class

c1.m1(25)
a = c1()
a.m1()
```

---

### 🔍 What’s going on?

#### 🔁 Two methods with the same name:
- You **first defined** a `@staticmethod m1()`.
- Then you **redefined** `m1()` as an **instance method**, and this one **overrides** the previous one.
- So, **the static method is lost** — the last definition of `m1()` is what remains.

---

### ✔ Interpreting Each Line:

#### ✅ `c1.m1(25)`
- Since only the **instance method** `m1(self)` exists now (the static one was overridden),
- You are calling it using the class, and manually passing `25` as `self`.
- So `self = 25`
- It prints:
  ```
  instance method
  25
  ```

#### ✅ `a = c1()`
- Creates an instance of `c1`.

#### ✅ `a.m1()`
- Calls the instance method on the object.
- Python automatically passes the instance `a` as `self`.

- It prints:
  ```
  instance method
  <__main__.c1 object at 0x...>
  ```

---

### ✅ Final Output:
```
instance method
25
instance method
<__main__.c1 object at 0x...>
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Line           | What it does                                  | Output                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `c1.m1(25)`    | Calls instance method with 25 as `self`       | `instance method\n25`              |
| `a = c1()`     | Creates instance                              | -                                  |
| `a.m1()`       | Calls instance method with `self = a`         | `instance method\n<obj memory>`    |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome question Sowmya! Let's go through everything step-by-step.

You're trying to understand:

1. ✅ **How to access a static (class) variable `x` in different contexts**
2. ✅ **How to call different methods (`m1`, `m2`, `m3`)**
3. ✅ Understand why `self.x`, `cls.x`, etc. work (or don’t)

---

### ✅ First, what is a static (class) variable?

In this example:
```python
class c1:
    x = 25  # static variable (aka class variable)
```
`x` is shared by all instances of the class.

---

### ✅ Let's clean up and fix your code **with proper comments**:

```python
class c1:
    x = 25  # static (class) variable

    def __init__(self):
        # Accessing static variable in __init__
        print("From __init__: c1.x =", c1.x)
        print("From __init__: self.x =", self.x)

    def m1(self):
        # Accessing static variable in instance method
        print("From m1: c1.x =", c1.x)
        print("From m1: self.x =", self.x)

    @classmethod
    def m2(cls):
        # Accessing static variable in class method
        print("From m2: cls.x =", cls.x)
        print("From m2: c1.x =", c1.x)

    @staticmethod
    def m3():
        # Accessing static variable in static method
        print("From m3: c1.x =", c1.x)
```

---

### ✅ Accessing Static Variable `x` — Different Ways

| Context               | Way 1             | Way 2           |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Inside `__init__`     | `c1.x`            | `self.x`         |
| Inside `m1()`         | `c1.x`            | `self.x`         |
| Inside `m2()`         | `cls.x`           | `c1.x`           |
| Inside `m3()`         | `c1.x`            | *(only way here)* |

🔸 `self.x` works because if an instance variable `x` doesn't exist, Python looks at the class variable.

🔸 `cls` is used inside `@classmethod`

🔸 `self` is used inside instance methods

---

### ❌ The following will cause **errors** if written outside class or wrong context:
- `print(x)` → `x` is not defined in local scope
- `print(self.x)` → `self` only exists in methods
- `print(cls.x)` → `cls` only exists in class methods

---

### ✅ Accessing Static Variable **Outside the Class**:

```python
print("Outside class: c1.x =", c1.x)
```

---

### ✅ Calling Methods

```python
obj = c1()      # calls __init__

obj.m1()        # instance method

c1.m2()         # class method (or obj.m2())

c1.m3()         # static method (or obj.m3())
```

---

### ✅ Final Output Example:

```python
obj = c1()
obj.m1()
c1.m2()
c1.m3()
print("From outside: c1.x =", c1.x)
```

Would give:
```
From __init__: c1.x = 25
From __init__: self.x = 25
From m1: c1.x = 25
From m1: self.x = 25
From m2: cls.x = 25
From m2: c1.x = 25
From m3: c1.x = 25
From outside: c1.x = 25
```

---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great question again, Sowmya! You're exploring **how to add static (class) variables in different parts of a class and program** — very useful for mastering Python OOP!

Let me walk you through the correct syntax **with proper comments** in every part of the code.

---

### ✅ Full Example With Comments:

```python
class c1:
    # Static variable 'a' added directly in class
    a = 10

    def __init__(self):
        # Static variable 'b' added from constructor using class name
        c1.b = 20

        # Instance variable 'c'
        self.c = 30

        # This is invalid: 'cls' is not defined in __init__
        # cls.k = 25  ❌ (will cause NameError)

    def m1(self):
        # Static variable 'd' added via class name
        c1.d = 40

        # Instance variable 'e'
        self.e = 50

    @classmethod
    def m2(cls):
        # Static variable 'f' added using cls
        cls.f = 60

        # Another way: using class name
        c1.g = 70

        # Invalid: 'self' is not defined in class method
        # self.k = 25 ❌

    @staticmethod
    def m3():
        # Static variable 'h' using class name
        c1.h = 80

        # self.k = 25 ❌ Invalid in static method
        # cls.k = 35 ❌ Invalid in static method
```

---

### ✅ Main Program

```python
print('Begin')
print(c1.__dict__)  # __dict__ shows class attributes
print()

x = c1()  # Calls constructor (__init__)
print('Constructor')
print(c1.__dict__)  # Now includes 'b'
print()

x.m1()  # Instance method
print('Instance method m1')
print(c1.__dict__)  # Now includes 'd'
print()

c1.m2()  # Class method
print('Class method m2')
print(c1.__dict__)  # Now includes 'f' and 'g'
print()

c1.m3()  # Static method
print('Static method m3')
print(c1.__dict__)  # Now includes 'h'
print()

# Add static variable 'i' outside class
c1.i = 90

# Add instance variable 'j' to object 'x'
x.j = 100

print('Outside the class')
print(c1.__dict__)
print()

print("Object 'x'")
print(x.__dict__)  # Shows only instance variables: c, e, j
```

---

### ✅ Final Output (Structure-wise):

```
Begin
{'__module__': '__main__', 'a': 10, ... }

Constructor
{'__module__': '__main__', 'a': 10, 'b': 20, ... }

Instance method m1
{'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'd': 40, ... }

Class method m2
{'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'd': 40, 'f': 60, 'g': 70, ... }

Static method m3
{'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'd': 40, 'f': 60, 'g': 70, 'h': 80, ... }

Outside the class
{'a': 10, ..., 'i': 90}

Object 'x'
{'c': 30, 'e': 50, 'j': 100}
```

---

### ✅ Summary Table – Ways to Add Static Variables:

| Location       | Syntax                       | Valid? |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------|
| Inside class   | `a = 10`                     | ✅     |
| Inside `__init__` | `c1.b = 20`               | ✅     |
| Inside instance method | `c1.d = 40`          | ✅     |
| Inside class method   | `cls.f = 60` or `c1.g = 70` | ✅ |
| Inside static method  | `c1.h = 80`           | ✅     |
| Outside the class     | `c1.i = 90`           | ✅     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great job tackling this one, Sowmya! This is a classic OOP + input + computation practice question. Let’s walk through it **step-by-step with inputs** and compute **final outputs** with full explanation.

---

### ✅ First: Understanding the class

```python
class Test:
    @classmethod
    def get1(cls):          # Static-like setup
        cls.x = int(input())

    def get2(self):         # Takes two inputs
        self.y = int(input())
        self.z = int(input())

    def compute(self):      # Increments all vars by 1
        Test.x += 1         # Class variable
        self.y += 1
        self.z += 1
        self.x += 1         # Adds an instance variable 'x' to the object

    def disp(self):
        print(Test.x, self.y, self.z, self.x, sep='\t')
```

---

### ✅ Inputs (in order):

```
10 → for Test.get1() → class variable x = 10

a.get2() → 20, 30       → a.y = 20, a.z = 30
b.get2() → 40, 50       → b.y = 40, b.z = 50
c.get2() → 60, 70       → c.y = 60, c.z = 70
```

---

### ✅ Running `compute()` for a, b, c:

#### `a.compute()`:
- `Test.x = 10 + 1 = 11`
- `a.y = 20 + 1 = 21`
- `a.z = 30 + 1 = 31`
- `a.x = 11 + 1 = 12` → instance variable `x = 12`

#### `b.compute()`:
- `Test.x = 11 + 1 = 12`
- `b.y = 40 + 1 = 41`
- `b.z = 50 + 1 = 51`
- `b.x = 12 + 1 = 13`

#### `c.compute()`:
- `Test.x = 12 + 1 = 13`
- `c.y = 60 + 1 = 61`
- `c.z = 70 + 1 = 71`
- `c.x = 13 + 1 = 14`

---

### ✅ Final Outputs from disp():

Each `disp()` prints:
```
Test.x   self.y   self.z   self.x
```

So we get:

#### `a.disp()`:
```
13      21      31      12
```

#### `b.disp()`:
```
13      41      51      13
```

#### `c.disp()`:
```
13      61      71      14
```

### ✅ Final Answer (Output):

```
13	21	31	12
13	41	51	13
13	61	71	14
```

Great exercise, Sowmya! Let's go step by step and **fill in the blanks** to complete your **vector addition program** in Python, along with answers to all your questions.

---

### ✅ Complete Program with Comments:

```python
class vector:
    # Static variable to store number of elements
    n = 0

    @staticmethod
    def get1():
        # Read number of elements into static variable 'n'
        vector.n = int(input("Enter number of elements: "))

    def get2(self):
        # Read list of numbers into instance variable 'a'
        self.a = []
        print("Enter", vector.n, "elements:")
        for i in range(vector.n):
            self.a.append(int(input(f"Element {i+1}: ")))

    def add(self, x, y):
        # Add x.a[i] + y.a[i] and store in self.a[i]
        self.a = []
        for i in range(vector.n):
            self.a.append(x.a[i] + y.a[i])
```

---

### ✅ Main Program (with answers to your questions):

```python
# 1) Names of objects → x, y, z
x = vector()
y = vector()
z = vector()

# Call static method to read number of elements → vector.n
vector.get1()

# 2) Lists held by objects → x.a, y.a, z.a
x.get2()  # Read list into x
y.get2()  # Read list into y

# 3) Access elements → x.a[i], y.a[i]
# 4) Access static variable → vector.n

# Add vectors: z = x + y
z.add(x, y)

# Print the result list held by z
print("Resultant vector (z):", z.a)
```

---

### ✅ Sample Input & Output (if inputs are 3 elements):

**Inputs:**
```
Enter number of elements: 3
Enter 3 elements:
Element 1: 1
Element 2: 2
Element 3: 3
Enter 3 elements:
Element 1: 4
Element 2: 5
Element 3: 6
```

**Output:**
```
Resultant vector (z): [5, 7, 9]
```

To print only the static variables of the class `c1` (and not the environment variables), you can use the `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods to filter out the environment variables from the `__dict__` attribute. Here's how you can write the program:

```python
class c1:
    x = 1
    y = 2
    z = 3

# Printing static variables using __dict__
static_variables = {key: value for key, value in c1.__dict__.items() if not key.startswith('__') and not key.endswith('__')}
print("Static variables of class c1:", static_variables)
```

### Explanation:
- `c1.__dict__` gives the dictionary of the class `c1`, including all its attributes (static variables and internal variables like `__dict__`, `__module__`, etc.).
- The `startswith('__')` and `endswith('__')` methods help filter out the internal variables of the class (such as `__dict__`, `__module__`, etc.), ensuring that only the static variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) are printed.

### Output:
```
Static variables of class c1: {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this code, you have various variables assigned within different scopes (class-level, instance-level, and function-level). Let's go through each variable and identify what they are based on their scope:

### Class `c1`
```python
class c1:
    x = 10  # Static variable of class `c1`
    def m1(self):
        self.y = 20  # Instance variable (specific to an object of `c1`)
        z = 30  # Local variable to method `m1`
        c1.m = 40  # Static variable of class `c1` (outside method scope)
```
- **x**: This is a **static variable** of class `c1`. It is shared across all instances of the class.
- **y**: This is an **instance variable**. It is specific to an instance (object) of the class. The value of `y` is assigned within the `m1()` method, so it will be unique to each instance.
- **z**: This is a **local variable** within the method `m1()`. It exists only within the method and is not accessible outside of it.
- **m**: This is a **static variable** added to class `c1` inside the method `m1()`. It is part of the class itself, not an instance, and will be shared by all instances of `c1`.

### Function `f1`
```python
def f1():
    a = c1()
    a.p = 50  # Instance variable of the object `a`
    c1.q = 60  # Static variable of class `c1`
    s = 70  # Local variable to function `f1`
```
- **p**: This is an **instance variable** of the object `a` created in the `f1()` function. It is specific to that particular instance of `c1`.
- **q**: This is a **static variable** of class `c1`, set inside the function `f1()`.
- **s**: This is a **local variable** inside the function `f1()`. It only exists within the function's scope.

### Outside Class and Function
```python
k = 80  # Global variable
c1.l = 90  # Static variable of class `c1`
b = c1()
b.n = 100  # Instance variable of the object `b`
```
- **k**: This is a **global variable**. It exists in the outermost scope, which is not inside any class or function.
- **l**: This is a **static variable** of class `c1`. It's defined outside the class, but it still belongs to the class.
- **n**: This is an **instance variable** of the object `b` created outside the class.

### Summary of each variable:
- **k**: Global variable.
- **l**: Static variable of class `c1`.
- **x**: Static variable of class `c1`.
- **y**: Instance variable (specific to an object of `c1`).
- **z**: Local variable (within the method `m1()`).
- **m**: Static variable of class `c1`.
- **p**: Instance variable (specific to an object `a`).
- **q**: Static variable of class `c1`.
- **s**: Local variable (within the function `f1()`).
- **n**: Instance variable (specific to an object `b`).
