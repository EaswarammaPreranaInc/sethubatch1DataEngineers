write a program to print characters of the string in forward and reverse directions without slicing
a=eval(input("enter any string:"))
print("string in forward")
for i in range(len(a)):
	print(F'character at index {i}:{a[i]}')
print()
print()
for i in range(1,len(a)+1):
	print(F'character at index {-i}:{a[-i]}')


output...
enter any string:'mahendra'
string in forward
character at index 0:m
character at index 1:a
character at index 2:h
character at index 3:e
character at index 4:n
character at index 5:d
character at index 6:r
character at index 7:a


character at index -1:a
character at index -2:r
character at index -3:d
character at index -4:n
character at index -5:e
character at index -6:h
character at index -7:a
character at index -8:m



#write program to concatenate two strings separated by space but swap the first two characters of each string
a=eval(input("enter value of a:"))
b=eval(input("enter value of b:"))
c=b[0:2 ]+a[2: ]
d=a[0:2 ]+b[2: ]
print(c,d,sep=" ")

output...
enter value of a:'java'
enter value of b:'python'

#write program to print first two and last two characters of 6the string
a=eval(input("enter any string:"))
b=len(a)
if b>=4:
	print(a[0:2]+a[-2]+a[-1])
else:
	print("nothing")

output...
enter any string:'pythn'
