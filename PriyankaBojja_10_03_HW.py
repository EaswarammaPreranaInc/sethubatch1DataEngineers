Write  a  program  to  print  distinct  vowels  of  the  string  without  using  set

1) Let  input  be   RaMA  rAo
    What  is  the  output ?  ---> AO

2) Hint  1:  Same  as   prog3e  with  minor  changes
3) What  does  'hyd' . upper()  do ? --->  Returns  'HYD'


a=input('Enter any string: ')
b='aeiou'
c=''
for x in a:
	if x in b and x not in c:
		c+=x
print(c.upper())	


Find all occurences of a word in a string using find() and walrus  operator

a = 'Hyd is green city. Hyd is hitec city. Hyd is his city'
index = -1
while  (index:= a . find('is' , index + 1)) != -1:
	print(index)
print('End')


(Home  work)
Find all occurences of a word in a string using index()
Hint: Use   try  and  except

a = 'Hyd is green city. Hyd is hitec city. Hyd is his city'
index = a . index('is')
while  index != -1:
	print(index)
	try:
		index = a . index('is' , index + 1)
	except ValueError:
		break
print('End')



index()  method
-------------------
It  is  same  as  find()  method  except  that  it  throws   error  when  string  is  not  found  (but  not  -1)
Syntax  is  same  as   find()  method

rfind()  method  demo  program

Modify  following  program  with  rfind()  method


a = 'Hyd is green city. Hyd is hitec city. Hyd is his city'
index = a . rfind('is')
while  index != -1:
	print(index)
	index = a . rfind('is' , 0 ,index)
print('End')


rfind()  method
-------------------
1) What  does  str1 . rfind(str2 , x , y)  do ?  --->  Returns  index  of  str2  in  str1   between  indexes  y - 1  downto  x  i.e. right  to  left
2) What  does  str1 . rfind(str2)  do ?  --->  Returns  index  of  str2  in  str1   between  indexes  len(str1) - 1  downto  0  i.e. right  to  left
3) What  does  str1 . rfind(str2 , x)  do ?  --->  Returns  index  of  str2  in  str1   between  indexes  x  to  len(â€¦

rindex()   method  demo  program
Modify  following  program  with  rindex()  method

Hint: Use   try  and  except

a = 'Hyd is green city. Hyd is hitec city. Hyd is his city'
index = a . rindex('is')
while  index != -1:
	print(index)
	try:
		index = a . rindex('is' ,0,index)
	except ValueError:
		break
print('End')


rindex()  method
--------------------
It  is  same  as   rfind()  method  except  that  it  throws  error   but  not  -1  when  string  is  not  found


#  count()  method  demo  program (Home  work)
a = 'Hyd is green city. Hyd is hitec city. Hyd is his city'
print(a . count('is'))
print(a . count('is' , 19 , 48))
print(a . count('was'))



count()
---------
1) What  does  str1 . count(str2)  do ? --->   Returns  number  of  times  str2  is  found  in  str1
2) What  does  str1 . count(str2 , x , y)  do ? --->  Returns  number  of  times  str2  is  found  in  str1  between  indexes  x  and  y - 1


#  Find  outputs  (Home  work)

Write  a  program  to  replace  every  occurance  of  first  character  in  the  string  with  '*'  except  first  character
Let  input  be  'babble'
What  is  the  output ?  --->  ba**le
Hint : Use  replace()  method

a = input('Enter any string: ')
first_char = a[0]
b=first_char+a[1:].replace(first_char,'*')
print('Result :', b)

OP-
Enter  any  string :  babble
Result :   ba**le

print(a . split())    # ['Hyd', 'is', 'green', 'city']
print(a . split('green'))  #['Hyd\nis ', '\tcity']
#print(a . split('')) #error- seperator is empty


# Find  outputs  (Home  work)
a = 'Hyd	is	green	city' #  There  is  tab  between  the  words
print(a . split('\t')) #['Hyd','is','green','city']
print(a . split())     #['Hyd','is','green','city']
print(a . split(' '))  #['Hyd\tis\tgreen\tcity']


# Find  outputs (Home  work)
a = 'Hyd   is   green   city'  #  There   are   3  spaces  between  the  words

Hint:  Use  split()  method

a = input('Enter the expression: ')
b = a.split('+')
total = 0
for i in b:
	total+= int(i)
print('Sum: ',total)

OP-
Enter the expression: 23+456+7
Sum:  486

Write  a  program  to  append  'ing'  to  input  string.
Append  'ly'  to  the  string  if  the  string  already  ends  with  'ing'.
Leave  the  string  unchanged  if  string  has  lessthan  three  characters

1) What  is  the  output  if  input  is  'interest' ?  --->  interesting

2) What  is  the  output  if  input  is  'interesting' ? --->  interestingly

3) What  is  the  output  if  input  is  Hi ?  --->  Hi  itself

4) Hint:  Use  endswith()  method

a=input('Enter string: ')
b=''
if len(a)<3:
	print(a)
else:
	if a.endswith('ing'):
		b=a+'ly'
	else:
