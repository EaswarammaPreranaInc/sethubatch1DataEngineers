The rate of data generation has increased throughout this century at a predictable rate more or less. According to Seagate UK, “By 2025, there will be 175 zettabytes of data in the global data-sphere”. Companies place a higher value on data.

Companies are discovering new ways to use data to their advantage. They use data to analyze the current status of their business, forecast the future, model their customers, avoid threats and develop new goods. Data Engineering is the linchpin in all these activities


What is Data Engineering ?.........................................................................................................................................................................................................

----> Data engineering forms the backbone of modern data-driven enterprises, encompassing the design, development, and maintenance of crucial systems and infrastructure for managing data throughout its lifecycle.

----> The field of data engineering is concerned with designing, constructing, and maintaining the support systems and infrastructures necessary for data inbound, storage, processing, and analysis. Data engineers manage huge sets of data in a real-time environment. They are supposed to provide high quality of information that is really usable by different business departments.

---->Data engineers deal with large volumes of data, often in real-time, and their role is crucial in enabling businesses to extract valuable insights from their data assets. They work closely with data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders to ensure that the data infrastructure supports the organization's goals and requirements.

What is the role of python in Data Engineering ?...........................................................................................................................................................................................

---->Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It is an open-source, high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum. Python’s simple, easy-to-learn and readable syntax makes it easy to understand and helps you write short-line codes. In addition to this, Python has an ocean of libraries that serve a plethora of use cases in the field of Data Engineering, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and many more. Some popular examples include Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, among many others. 

---->Python lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. It has a huge robust global community with many tech giants like Google, Facebook, Netflix, IBM having dependencies on it. Python allows interactive testing and debugging of code snippets and provides interfaces to all major commercial databases. Python for Data Engineering uses all the features of Python and fine-tunes it for all your Data Engineering needs.


Final Thoughts.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................

---->Data engineering is an increasingly vital field in today's data-driven world. Its significance is reflected in the diverse roles and responsibilities of data engineers, from generalists to specialists in storage, programming, pipelines, and analytics. The field offers a dynamic and challenging career path, with the opportunity to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies.

---->For those considering a career in data engineering or looking to enhance their skills, the journey is both rewarding and demanding. Key skills like SQL, data modeling and Python, form the foundation of a competent data engineer's toolkit. However, remember that the technical prowess must be balanced with essential soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and effective communication.


Note: A Quick Overview on python is being written in the next part for basic understanding of forthcoming programs on various topics.


..........................................................................................Introduction to Python .................................................................................................................

Python is a general purpose high level programming language.Guido van Rossam has designed python in 1989,but released in the market in 1991.Python is derived from 'C' and 'ABC' language.

What does Python support ? .......................................................................................................................................................................................................

----> Python is a functional programming language.
----> Python is a Object oriented language.
----> Python is a scripting lanuage.
----> Python is a modular programming language.

Where is Python Used ? ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................

----> Desktop applications
----> Web applications
----> Database applications becoz python supports PDBC(Python Data Base Connectivity)
----> Networking aplications
----> Games
----> Data Science applications
----> Machine learning applications
----> Artificial Intelligence
----> Internet of Things.

Features of Python ............................................................................................................................................................................................................

----> Simple and Easy to learn
----> Free Ware
----> Platform Independent
----> Portability
----> Dynamically typed language
----> Procedure oriented and object oriented
----> Interpreter language
----> Extensible
----> Embedded
----> Extensive library

Limitations ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................

----> Low Performance (since it is an interpreted language, it checks for line by line translation and execeution making the process slow).
----> Python is not suitable for mobile aplications.
----> Python does not support variable,pointer,array,structure and union.

Python Objects.................................................................................................................................................................................................................

There are 11 objects in python

----> int (contain only integers for eg: 3,5,-7 -11 also range is -infinity to + infinity)
----> float (contains integers with decimal point eg: 3.5,7.2 also range is as above one)
----> complex (contains real  and imag numbers of the form 3+4j where 3 is real 4 is imaj note:j is mandatory before imag number)
----> bool (contains 0 and 1 only)
----> NoneType

Note: The above 5 are non sequences or interable/collection (contains single element)..........................................................................................................................................

----> str (contains alphnumeric characters in single,double and triple quotes (single or double)
----> range (contains sequence of numbers set by the condition)
----> list (a mutable, built in data structure that stores ordered sequence of elements.enclosed in [])
----> tuple (a collection of values that are ordered and cannot be changed.enclosed in ())
----> set ( used to store multiple items in a single variable enclosed in {})
----> dictonary (a data structure that stores key-value pairs enclosed in {})

Note: The above 6 are sequences (group of elements)...........................................................................................................................................................................


Few points to Remember:
----> Comments: single line (#) multi line(''') used for better reability for users and to understand the logic behind the code precisely. 
----> built-ins module contains these(11 objects) built in data structures.

NOTE: GOING FOWARD, WE CREATE SEPARATE FILES FOR SPECIFIC TOPIC AND  LINE BY LINE EXPLANATION BY COMMENTS THERE ITSELF FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CODE BOTH THEORITICALLY AND PRACTICALLY.
BASICALLY THE HAND ON LEARNING EXCERCISES WIL BE DOCUMENTED FOR FUTURE PURPOSE.
